## Overview

Welcome to Project 42 Philosophers! This collaborative initiative delves into the world of parallel computing by tackling the classic dining philosophers problem. The project seamlessly integrates philosophical challenges with concurrent programming, offering a unique and intellectually stimulating experience.

## Key Features

- **Parallel Computing:** Delve into the world of parallelism to optimize solutions.
- **Skill Enhancement:** Sharpen your programming skills while unraveling the mysteries of parallel execution.

## Getting Started

### Rules

Before running the project, it's essential to understand the following rules:

1. **Number of Philosophers:**
   - Specify the total number of philosophers as a command-line argument.

2. **Time Constraints:**
   - Adjust time constraints for various actions, including `time_to_die`, `time_to_eat`, and `time_to_sleep`.

3. **Number of Times Each Philosopher Must Eat:**
   - Optionally set the number of times each philosopher must eat before the simulation ends.

4. **Order of Execution:**
   - When running the executable, ensure the options are provided in the correct order: `[number_of_philosophers] [time_to_die] [time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep] [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]`.

To get started with Project 42 Philosophers, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:manugonz42/Philosophers.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Philosophers
    ```

3. **Compile the code:**
    ```bash
    make
    ```

4. **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    ./philosophers [number_of_philosophers] [time_to_die] [time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep] *[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
    ```

Let's shape the future of parallel computing
